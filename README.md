web-book-reader
===============

A little Web (Javascript) e-book reader prototype to read epub and pdf files into a browser. This is more a poof of concept than a real application.

I Used the pdf-data-extractor in order to extract pdf data for the pdf-reader.

Extracted book samples will be online soon.

A demo of this prototype is here : http://demos.bumble-bee.fr/web-book-reader/

I wrote a short explanation (in french) here : http://www.bumble-bee.fr/articles/demos/bumblebee_book_reader_1
