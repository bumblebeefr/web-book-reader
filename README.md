web-book-reader
===============

A little Web (Javascript) e-book reader prototype to read epub and pdf files into a browser. This is more a poof of concept than a real application.

I Used the [pdf-data-extractor](https://github.com/bumblebeefr/pdf-data-extractor) in order to extract pdf data for the pdf-reader.


A demo of this prototype is here : http://demos.bumble-bee.fr/web-book-reader/ (
Extracted book samples I used in the d√©mo will be online soon.)

I wrote a short explanation (in french) here : http://www.bumble-bee.fr/articles/demos/bumblebee_book_reader_1
